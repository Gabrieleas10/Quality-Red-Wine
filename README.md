# Quality-Red-Wine

 Kaggle's Dataset

# Context

The dataset is related to red  variants of the wine. For more details, consult the reference [Cortez et al., 2009]. Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.).

These dataset can be viewed as classification or regression tasks. The classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are much more normal wines than excellent or poor ones).

# Content

For more information, read [Cortez et al., 2009].

Input variables (based on physicochemical tests):

1 - fixed acidity

2 - volatile acidity

3 - citric acid

4 - residual sugar

5 - chlorides

6 - free sulfur dioxide

7 - total sulfur dioxide

8 - density

9 - pH

10 - sulphates

11 - alcohol

Output variable (based on sensory data):

12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)

Tips
What might be an interesting thing to do, is aside from using regression modelling, is to set an arbitrary cutoff for your dependent variable (wine quality) at e.g. 7 or higher getting classified as 'good/1' and the remainder as 'not good/0'.
This allows you to practice with hyper parameter tuning on e.g. decision tree algorithms looking at the ROC curve and the AUC value.
Without doing any kind of feature engineering or overfitting you should be able to get an AUC of .88 (without even using random forest algorithm)
